# Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2023
## Using Modules 1: Core Modules

## Using Modules 2: Our Own Modules
- In NodeJS, actually `every single file` is treated as `a module`.
- Export & Import module as a function
- `NPM` & the `package.json` file
    - `npm` is actually both `the command line interface` app that we use to manage the packages and also `the repository` itself.
    - it actually comes already `pre-installed with NodeJS.`
    - npm init
    - package.json
- Types of Packages and Installs
    - What is a dependency ?
    - Installing regular dependency
    - Installing development dependency
    - Installing locally (npm install ...)
    - Installing global (npm install --global)
    - Running project globally dependency: nodemon index.js
    - Running project locally dependency: `specify a npm script` -> `npm run start`
